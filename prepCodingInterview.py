Objective: Review and remember ONLY important practices of Data Structure and Algorithms for Coding Interviews

Note concepts, Pseudocode, Python, C++.

"Coding in timing"

//Binary Search of ordered List

//Interpolation Search of ordered List

//Insertion Sort

//Shell Sort

//Heapsort on the Heap data structure

//Distribution sort - Bucket Sort

//Radix Sort

//Quick Sort

//Merge Sort

//Divide and Conquer technique
The master theorem:

//Matrix Multiplication

//Skyline problem

//Dynamic Programming applications*
Idea: using more spaces to store the subproblems instead of paying processing of repeat problems (as recursive ways). Bottom-up.

Very frequently asked in interviews:

    //Common Substrings, Subsequences
    //Optimal Binary Search
    //Nim 
    //Fibonacci
    //Knapsack
    //

//Hash

//
