           Show the version number of the Valgrind core. Tools can have their own version numbers. There is a[m
           scheme in place to ensure that tools only execute when the core version is one they are known to work[m
           with. This was done to minimise the chances of strange problems arising from tool-vs-core version[m
           incompatibilities.[m
